# iFollow

iFollow is a Python writen program for Instagram to follow a specific user from multiple accounts.

## Installation

Put accounts on given file on format username:password

```bash
Accounts.txt
```

## What's New On v3.0

```python

1. The bug that was exiting the tool after followed from one account is FIXED,
2. Made the tool faster
3. Added some sleep between login accounts to avoid bann.,
Everything Cool :)
# if you have any debuggable tools like HttpDebugger, DnSpy, IlSpy, BurpSuite etc..
the program will exit()

```
## Photo when everything goes ok
1. You enter the user you want to follow,
2. The tool login's from Accounts.txt,
3. Check's if user exists or not from SessionID of logged in Account,
4. Tries to follow and give's the response if good or spam or whatever,
5. Then loggins on Account 2 and tries the same process.
